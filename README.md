spicerack
=========

A general utility cookbook for Chef.  Spicerack provides libraries for advertising and discovering cookbook aspects such as logfiles, services, ports, and directories.  It also provides a mechanism for providing processing "hints" to cookbooks that make automated decisions about configurations. The cookbook borrows from the concepts set forth in the infochimps  silverware cookbooks, and I am indebted to them for blazing the trail with regards to aspect based chef development.
